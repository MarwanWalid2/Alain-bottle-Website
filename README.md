# Alain-Website
This is an unofficial website to advertise and present how good, durable, ecofreindly are the products of Alain. 

The website is built to encourage user interaction by allowing users to navigate to various areas, learn about the company's success, view various items, and get in touch with the team at the site's conclusion. In order to give the user the relaxing impression of water while scrolling to discover Alain's tale, the website's theme and the UI colors are based on a water theme (blue).

I started by picking up the first item in front of me, which forced me to step outside of my comfort zone because it was just a plain water bottle. I then went on to discover what makes this bottle unique and let my creativity take over, which led to the advertisement I filmed and the straightforward but effective website I created. 

Overall, I am confident to say that my vision of the concept was well represented through my work, despite the few challenges I encountered throughout the process. By the end of this project, I expected to have a working site that also looked aesthetically pleasing and that met my requirements of what is considered high quality.
